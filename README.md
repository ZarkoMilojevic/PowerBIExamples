# Power BI Logistics Examples (3 Standalone Projects)

This repo contains three end‑to‑end examples you can open in Power BI using the included CSVs. Each project highlights practical logistics/transportation analytics and solid DAX/visualization skills.

1. **Last‑Mile Delivery Performance** — on‑time rate, delay analysis, route productivity, geo map, field parameters.
2. **Warehouse Replenishment & Inventory Aging** — DoS, demand trends, receipts vs shipments, aging buckets, decomposition tree.
3. **Fleet Fuel & Emissions (Cloud‑Connected)** — Azure Blob data, scheduled refresh, fuel efficiency, CO2e intensity, rolling windows.

> Import CSVs, create relationships, add the DAX measures from each project README, and design visuals as described.
